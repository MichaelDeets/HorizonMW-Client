# Introduction

This copy of HorizonMW's source code, has been altered to run under a WINE environment on Linux. Do NOT attempt to run this binary from Windows, you WILL have problems. While this is for Linux only, some users have reported success with use on MacOS. I will not provide any support outside of Linux.

For pre-compiled WINE-compliant binaries please see [releases](https://github.com/MichaelDeets/HorizonMW-Client/releases) for more information.


## Installation

Download `h2m-mod.exe` from [releases](https://github.com/MichaelDeets/HorizonMW-Client/releases), place this file inside your HorizonMW root directory.

Note: Using HMW Launcher to verify the files will replace `h2m-mod.exe` with the original copy (that doesn't work in Linux). If you use HMW Launcher to verify files, make sure to re-replace the `h2m-mod.exe` file inside the root directory.

## Bugs / Issues

Please report any issues you have with running `h2m-mod.exe` through WINE/Linux. If you have problems unrelated to WINE/Linux, instead use the original [HorizonMW GitHub](https://github.com/HorizonMW/HorizonMW-Client).

## Game not launching

1: Try running `h2m-mod.exe` from Steam (add a non-Steam game), using Proton Experimental or Proton GE.

2: Try adding `-nosteam` as a launch option.

# Notes for users updating from v1.3.0 to v1.3.1

## Stats have reset!?

For an immediate solution (as of 2024/10/24) for v1.3.1 users, try using the [v1.3.1-staging release](https://github.com/MichaelDeets/HorizonMW-Client/releases/tag/v1.3.1-staging). You can find out more information using either release page for v1.3.1 or v1.3.1-staging.

## Game hangs on the first loading screen

Try re-adding the shortcut to Steam.
