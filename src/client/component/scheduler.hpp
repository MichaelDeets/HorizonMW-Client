	Title: HMW/H2-Mod Scheduling System

	Description:
	Choosing the optimal pipeline/thread for the different tasks is cruicial for a good / smooth user experience. 
	Asynchronous in this context means pipelines/threads completly unrelated to the game threads. We should call them HMW client threads.
	The base delay of any pipeline is 10ms if not manually adjusted.

	Guidelines for use:
	1. Always assign tasks to the appropriate pipeline to maintain smooth game performance and avoid bottlenecks.
	2. Tasks related to the game should use the appropriate game related thread.
		- renderer -> The game's rendering pipeline
		- server -> The game's server thread
		- main -> The game's main thread
		- lui -> For the lui context
	3. Anything unrelated to the actual game which is loaded within memory we should definetly use our HMW client threads/pipelines.
		- async -> Asynchronuous pipeline, disconnected from the game, our main thread for the HMW client
		- network -> HMW client network related pipeline, mainly for IO bound tasks related to web requests (base delay of 50ms instead of 10ms)
	4. For HMW internal dev's anticheat related pipelines do not use for anything else, timing matters alot there
